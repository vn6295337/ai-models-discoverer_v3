HUGGINGFACE GENERATIVE AI MODALITIES
================================================================================

Verified generative pipeline tags across different modalities
Source: HuggingFace API direct testing
Verified: 2025-10-05
Updated: 2025-10-05 (removed non-existent tags)

================================================================================
ENABLED MODALITIES (5)
================================================================================

We filter for these generative modalities in our pre-fetch API calls:

NLP (Natural Language Processing):
  ✓ text-generation              (3500+ models) - Generate text from prompts

Computer Vision:
  ✓ text-to-image                (3500+ models) - Generate images from text
  ✓ text-to-video                (11+ models)   - Generate videos from text

Audio:
  ✓ text-to-speech               (2+ models)    - Generate speech from text
  ✓ text-to-audio                (12+ models)   - Generate audio/music from text

================================================================================
REMOVED TAGS (Previously Listed, Don't Exist)
================================================================================

These tags were previously listed but do NOT exist in HuggingFace API:

  ✗ text2text-generation - Tag doesn't exist; seq2seq models use specific tags
                           (summarization, translation) or text-generation
  ✗ conversational       - Tag doesn't exist; dialogue models use text-generation

Note: Verified via direct API testing. Both return empty [] even without filters.

FILTERING STRATEGY
================================================================================

Our Overall Approach:
  Start conservatively with core generative types - focusing on models that
  create entirely new creative content from text prompts.

Decision Criteria:
  1. Must generate new creative content (not just transform/classify)
  2. Prefer text-prompt-based generation (text-to-X)
  3. Focus on media generation (text, images, video, audio)
  4. Prioritize higher model counts (more ecosystem support)
  5. Exclude tasks requiring non-text inputs initially
  6. Must exist as actual pipeline_tag in HuggingFace API

Why We Disabled Certain Modalities:

  NLP Tasks (summarization, translation, fill-mask):
    - Transform or complete existing text rather than generating entirely
      new creative content
    - May enable later if scope expands

  CV Transformation (image-to-image, image-to-video, video-to-video):
    - Require existing visual content as input
    - Not pure text-to-content generation
    - Starting with text-based generation only

  Specialized CV (unconditional-image-generation, text-to-3d, image-to-3d):
    - Lower model counts (2-15 models)
    - Specialized use cases
    - Prioritizing higher-volume categories first

  Audio Transformation (audio-to-audio):
    - Requires existing audio as input
    - Not pure text-to-audio generation
    - Starting with text-based audio generation only

  Multimodal (any-to-any, *-text-to-text):
    - Generate text output (captions, descriptions) rather than creative
      media content
    - May reconsider if scope includes text generation from non-text inputs
