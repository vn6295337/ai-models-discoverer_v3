  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Provides official license URL mappings for non-Meta models that use known license types (like Llama licenses from Nous Research models)",

  "problem": "Non-Meta models with Llama licenses (e.g., Nous: Hermes 3 405B) get HuggingFace README/LICENSE URLs instead of official Llama license URLs. Meta-branded models ('Meta: Llama 3.1...') are handled correctly by Stage D, but non-Meta Llama models ('Nous: Hermes 3...') go through Stage J which only fetches HF URLs.",

  "solution": "Stage J checks this config before fetching HuggingFace URLs. If a model's license_name matches an entry here, the official URL is used instead of the HF URL. This ensures non-Meta Llama models get the same official license URLs as Meta models.",

  "usage": "Used by Stage J (J_custom_license_urls.py) to override HuggingFace-based license URLs with official license URLs for known license types",
